 <h3 id="intro"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
      <p>For <strong>France</strong>, the Agreement covers  the social insurance system for nonagricultural and  agricultural employees, laws on prevention and compensation of occupational  accidents and illnesses, nonoccupational accident insurance and insurance  against occupational accidents and illnesses for self-employed persons in  agricultural occupations, family benefits, system for seamen, sickness and  maternity insurance for agricultural and nonagricultural self-employed workers,  old-age allowances and old-age insurance for agricultural and nonagricultural  self-employed workers, old-age and invalidity insurance for clergymen and  members of religious orders, old-age and invalidity insurance for attorneys,  and laws concerning old-age insurance for agricultural self-employed workers.</p>
<!-- ALERT BLUE -->
	<div class="alert-blue"><strong>Note:</strong> In addition to retirement, disability  and survivors benefits, French social security taxes cover several other  benefit programs including France&rsquo;s national health insurance program. As a  result, a worker exempted from paying French social security taxes by the  Agreement cannot receive free health care services or other benefits under the  French health insurance system. If you meet all of the other requirements for exemption  from French social security taxes while working in France, you or your employer  must arrange for private health insurance before the exemption may apply.	</div>

        <h3 id="coverage-self">Eliminating dual coverage for self-employment</h3>
        <p>Self-employed workers who work only in  the United States are assigned U.S. coverage. Self-employed workers who work  only in France are assigned French coverage. Self-employed workers who normally  work in the United States but transfer their business activity to France for two years or fewer are assigned U.S. coverage. Self-employed workers who  normally work in France but transfer their business activity to the U.S. for  two years or fewer are assigned French coverage. Self-employed workers who work  in both countries with principal activity in France are assigned French  coverage. Self-employed workers who work in both countries with principal  activities in the United States are assigned U.S. coverage. </p>

<h3 id="monthly">Monthly benefits</h3>

<p>Under the U.S. Social Security system,  you may earn up to four credits each year depending on the amount of your  covered earnings. For example, in 2022, you receive one credit for each $1,410  of your covered annual earnings up to a maximum of four credits per year. The  amount needed to earn a work credit goes up slightly each year. For more  information, see <a href="https://ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10072.pdf"><em>How You Earn Credits </em>(Publication No. 05-10072)</a><em>.</em> </p>
<p>The French system measures credits in  calendar quarters. <strong>To simplify the information, the table shows requirements  in years of credits.</strong></p>

<h3 id="eligibility">How benefits can be paid</h3>
	
<p>If you have social security credits in  both the United States and France, you may be eligible for benefits from one or  both countries. If you meet all the basic requirements under one country&rsquo;s system,  you will get a regular benefit from that country. If you do not meet the basic  requirements, the Agreement may help you qualify for a benefit as explained  below.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Benefits from the United States—</strong>If  you do not have enough work credits under the U.S. system to qualify for  regular benefits, you qualify for a partial benefit from the United States  based on both United States and French credits. However, you must have earned  at least six credits (generally one and one-half years of work) under the U.S. system  for the United States to count your French credits. If you already have enough  credits under the U.S. system to qualify for a benefit, the United States  cannot count your French credits. </li>
    <li><strong>Benefits from France—</strong>Under  French law, a worker can qualify for an old-age pension based on as little as  one calendar quarter of contributions but the benefit amount is reduced for  workers with fewer than 150-160 quarters (depending on year of birth). Under  the Agreement, France will compute an old-age pension based on French credits  alone as well as a prorated benefit based on United States and French credits,  and then pay whichever is greater. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not have enough work credits  under the French system to qualify for regular disability or survivors  benefits, you may be able to qualify for a partial benefit from France based on  both United States and French credits. However, to have your U.S. credits  counted, you must have at least one year of coverage under the French system.</p>

<h3 id="payment">Payment of benefits</h3>
	
<p>Each country pays its own benefit. The  U.S. Department of the Treasury issues U.S. payments each month which covers  benefits for the preceding month.</p>
Under the French system,  France makes payments at different times for different periods depending on the  type of benefits.<strong> </strong>For more information, contact the  French authorities at the address in the section titled, &ldquo;<a href="#more-info">For more information</a>.&rdquo;
